# 🕵️ SpyAI - Intelligent Surveillance System (🛠️ currently under developement)

> **⚠️ DEVELOPMENT STATUS NOTICE**: This application is currently under active development and is not yet ready for production use. Features are being implemented progressively and may be incomplete or subject to changes.

A sophisticated cross-platform application that captures, transcribes, and analyzes audio recordings using advanced AI technology. Built for discreet monitoring with powerful natural language querying capabilities.

## 🎯 Overview

SpyAI combines cutting-edge mobile recording technology with Google's Gemini AI to create an intelligent surveillance solution. The app captures high-quality audio in 3-minute chunks, automatically transcribes conversations in multiple languages, and stores everything in a queryable database for later analysis.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend (Flutter)
- **Cross-platform mobile app** supporting iOS and Android
- **Advanced audio recording** with optimized settings for distant voices
- **Chunked upload system** for reliable long-duration recordings
- **Modern dark UI** with secretive, professional design
- **Real-time recording monitoring** with duration tracking

### Backend (FastAPI)
- **RESTful API server** built with Python FastAPI
- **AI-powered transcription** using Google Gemini 2.5-flash
- **Multi-language support** (English, Hindi, Hinglish)
- **PostgreSQL database integration** via Supabase
- **Natural language querying** system for transcript search

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📱 Mobile App
- ✅ **High-quality audio recording** (WAV, 96kbps, 44.1kHz)
- ✅ **Long-duration support** with automatic 3-minute chunking
- ✅ **Smart permission handling** with user-friendly dialogs
- ✅ **Retry mechanism** for failed uploads with exponential backoff
- ✅ **Auto-cleanup** of temporary files to prevent storage issues

### 🤖 AI Processing
- ✅ **Advanced transcription** with speaker identification
- ✅ **Name inference** - automatically replaces "Person 1" with actual names
- ✅ **Preserves natural speech** including fillers and informal language
- ✅ **Handles Hinglish** and code-switching seamlessly
- ✅ **Timestamp tracking** for precise recording attribution

### 🗃️ Data Management
- ✅ **PostgreSQL database** for structured transcript storage
- ✅ **Supabase integration** for real-time capabilities
- ✅ **SQL query generation** from natural language requests
- ✅ **Transcript refinement** for contextual question answering
